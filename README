These are my own vim customization files which are usually very personal.
However, you could take advantage of them if you will.

Here are some special notes and structure for this configuration.

0. Install git first. On ubuntu machine use:
  sudo apt-get install git-core
1. Install vundle first. I am using vundle vim plugin to manage all of my plugins, including this configuration.
  git clone https://github.com/gmarik/vundle.git ~/.vim/bundle/vundle
  git clone https://github.com/gramic/dotvim.git ~/.vim/bundle/dotvim
2. Make link in your .vim directory to this .vimrc file. That way you can modify and push the changes back to this GitHub repository.
  ln -s ~/.vim/bundle/dotvim/.vimrc ~/.vimrc

There is some more dot files like the tmux.
  sudo apt-get install tmux
  ln -s ~/.vim/bundle/dotvim/.tmux.conf ~/.tmux.conf
